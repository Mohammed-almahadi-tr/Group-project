# Group-project
Overview
This project is the first step in building an art store website. The objective is to create a simple HTML-based art gallery viewer that features a main page linking to six individual gallery pages, each displaying highlighted artworks and location information.

Files Structure
proj1.html – Main landing page with links to six galleries.

gallery1.html to gallery6.html – Individual gallery pages.

gallery-header.jpg, gallery-thin.png – Header images.

gallery1.png to gallery6.png – Square images for galleries.

gallery1-1.jpg to gallery6-4.jpg – Highlight images per gallery.

information.txt – Contains gallery details, including addresses and map coordinates.

Instructions
1. Main Page (proj1.html)
Contains seven <img> elements:

One header image: gallery-header.jpg.

Six square images for each gallery.

Each gallery image should be a clickable link to its corresponding page (e.g., gallery1.png → gallery1.html).

All six image elements should be placed on one line in HTML to avoid unwanted white space between them.

2. Gallery Pages (gallery1.html to gallery6.html)
Display:

A header image: gallery-thin.png (clickable, links back to proj1.html).

Four highlight images, e.g., gallery1-1.jpg, gallery1-2.jpg, etc.

Testing Tips
Open proj1.html in a browser and check:

All links to gallery pages work correctly.

Each gallery page has a working link back to proj1.html.

All Google Maps links open the correct location.

There is no extra spacing between square gallery images on the main page.
